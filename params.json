{"name":"Monkey","tagline":"Does what I need, so I can do what I like.","body":"Personal Home/Office Automation Monkey [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ustuehler/monkey.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ustuehler/monkey)\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI'm slowly teaching my monkey to do all the chores that I don't like.  Every\r\nnow and then I teach it a new trick, but for now, here's what it can do...\r\n\r\n**Accounting**\r\n\r\n- manipulates human-readable [ledger](http://ledger-cli.org) files\r\n- imports bank statements in CSV format\r\n\r\n**Banking**\r\n\r\n- does online-banking via HBCI (using aqbanking-cli)\r\n  - checks account balances\r\n  - issues transfers\r\n\r\n**Small-business management**\r\n\r\n- keeps track of my customers and suppliers\r\n- generates time-sheets for contract work\r\n- generates invoices ready to send\r\n\r\n**E-mail processing**\r\n\r\n- received invoices to account for business expenses\r\n- time-recording reports for invoice generation\r\n\r\nNote: Not everything is already published, some things are still implemented as\r\ncrude Rake scripts, using \"monkey\" only as a Ruby library.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nMy monkey's primary interface is a self-documenting command-line application,\r\nbut it can also be used directly from Ruby as library.  I personally prefer to\r\nuse pry during development and when I need something from my monkey that can't\r\nbe requested yet via the command-line interface.\r\n\r\nHere's how to get started:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nbundle install\r\nbundle exec bin/monkey\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-49279052-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
